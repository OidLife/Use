# Use-Policy
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

## OID (oid.life) "*The Opioid Coin*" is not responsible for wallets, mining, software, hardware and/or any transactional issues that may occur.
**Use the OID blockchain at your own risk.**

## Policy
We reserve the right to refuse miners, we make that choice based on if a miner is "befitting" the pool or not.
If a miner is not blocking at expected intervals, they are not "benefiting" the pool and may get blacklisted! 
Their funds will be withheld, and the shares/block reward will be distributed to every other miner.


Thank you,
